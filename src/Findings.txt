After running the program several times there is noticable difference in the overall performance depending on how large the inputs are. At 250x250 the program completes in about .05 seconds on average, and at 500x500 the program completes in about 0.19 seconds on average, and at 1000x1000 the program completes on average in about 0.5 seconds. Somewhat unexpected is that the execution times did not just double when the images doubled, but instead appear to have tripled. Perhaps because there are 3 separate functions that are doubling.
